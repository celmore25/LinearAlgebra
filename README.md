# Personal Notes/Learning for Linear Algebra

The notebooks and code in this repo generally follow the applied linear algebra book [Here](http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/vmls.pdf)

## Chapter 1: Vectors

Topics
* General definitions
* Operations
  * Addition, subtraction
  * Scaling
  * Dot/Inner product

## Chapter 2: Linear Functions

Topics
* "Superposition" means $f(ax + by) = af(x) + bf(y)$
* "Affine" Function means $f(x) = a^{T}x + b$. Affine functions satisfy the superposition principle
* Taylor Series Approximations

## Chapter 3: Distance Properties

Topics
* Euclidean Distance
* Cauchy-Schwarz inequality
* Angles for orthogonality and other properties
* Correlation
* Z-scores/normalization of vectors
* Standard Deviations

## Chapter 4: Clustering

Topics
* K-means
* Clustering use cases

## Chapter 5: Linear Independence

Topics
* Basis sets
* Dependence and independence qualities
* Gram-Schmidt algorithm

## Chapter 6: Matricies

Topics
* basic defintions
* basic operations - addition, multiplication, norm

## Chapter 7: Matrix Examples

Topics
* Geometric Transformations
* Convolutions

## Chapter 8: Linear Equations

Topics
* General properties of linear systems
* Examples of physical occurences: reactions, mass flow, electric systems

## Chapter 9: Linear Dynamic Systems

Topics
* Generalized linear systems
* Markov systems
* Example linear dynamics: inventory, epidemics, population ages

## Chapter 10: Matrix Multiplication

Topics
* General matrix multiplication rules and properties
* Orthonormal properties
* QR factorization

## Chapter 11: Matrix Inverses

Topics
*
